- Create a file named `.env` in the root folder.
- Add the following variables to the `.env` file:

   If you face issues with Google authentication, double-check your .env file settings and the Authorized JavaScript Origin in your Google Developer Console.
   Ensure your server is running and accessible via the specified VITE_SERVER_URL.
